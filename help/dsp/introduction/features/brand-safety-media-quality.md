# Brand Safety and Media Quality

<!-- Check on logo sizes in staging environment -- I made them all 100 pixels high except for DoubleVerify, which is 150 (harder to see at 100), but some instances look larger in VS Code. -->

Advertising Cloud DSP provides a suite of brand protection features to ensure that each of your campaigns reaches real users in a brand-safe environment.

Our Fraud Surveillance team works closely with industry leading partners, such as the [!DNL Interactive Advertising Bureau], [!DNL Trust and Accountability Group] [!DNL (TAG)], and [!DNL WhiteOps], to carefully curate the inventory on our platform. Through proactive management of our supply, DSP ensures that all advertisers across the platform are protected from non-human traffic (bots, crawlers, datacenter traffic, and fraud) and deliver only in brand-safe contexts.

In addition to providing central quality management, we believe in empowering advertisers to design the controls that align with their brand. Adobe Advertising Cloud offers integrations with [!DNL Comscore], [!DNL DoubleVerify], [!DNL Integral Ad Science], [!DNL Oracle Data Cloud], and [!DNL Peer39], ensuring that each advertiser can choose their desired level of fraud protection, contextual filtering, and keyword targeting.

## Advertising Cloud DSP Quality Initiatives

### Inventory Verification with [!DNL Ads.txt] Support

[[!DNL Ads.txt], which stands for [!DNL Authorized Digital Sellers]](https://iabtechlab.com/ads-txt) is an initiative launched by the [!DNL Interactive Advertising Bureau] ([!DNL IAB]) in June 2017 to facilitate the proper representation of inventory on the open market, thereby combatting illegitimate sources of traffic and domain spoofing. Participating publishers and distributors publicly declare the companies authorized to sell their digital inventory, and the nature of those relationships, by maintaining an `ads.txt` page at the top level of the domain (such as `example.com/ads.txt`).

DSP supports [!DNL ads.txt] by reading each publisher's `ads.txt` file and giving you the option to purchase only from verified [!DNL ads.txt] sellers. For example, by matching the sellers we see accessing `nytimes.com` to the New York Times' `ads.txt` file, we can identify which are legitimate and which are not, and we'll block the offenders if the placement is configured to purchase only from verified sellers. <!-- can we actually mention NY Times? -->

You can set default [!DNL ads.txt] controls for each advertiser<!-- [default ads.txt controls for each advertiser](/help/dsp/admin/advertiser-settings.md) -->, and then optionally [customize the settings for each placement](/help/dsp/campaign-management/placements/placement-settings.md) to:

* buy inventory from a domain's authorized direct sellers only

* buy inventory from a domain's authorized direct sellers and resellers only

* prioritize buying inventory from a domain's authorized direct sellers and resellers

* buy inventory from all sellers

### Platform Fraud Surveillance

DSP has built strong internal tools and systems to manage fraud across our platform, partnering with leading industry vendors such as [!DNL Whiteops] and [!DNL Integral Ad Science].

In addition, Adobe works closely with [!DNL IAB] and [!DNL TAG] to ensure robust, industry-standard fraud blocking to protect our advertisers, leveraging tools such as [!DNL ads.txt] (see the previous section), the [!DNL IAB] Bots and Spiders list, and the [!DNL TAG] Datacenter IP list.

Through our multi-dimensional approach to quality, our team monitors anomalies and invalid traffic patterns, ensuring less than 3% invalid traffic on protected inventory. Any inventory that is suspicious &mdash; including inventory on specific domains or from specific publishers or sellers &mdash; is immediately blocked across the platform.

### Inventory Mapping, Tiering, and Categorization

Inventory mapping is the detailed review and on-boarding process required for all new inventory before it's added to our platform. This process is designed to ensure the safety and quality of all inventory on DSP.

* **Mapping:** Our Inventory team reviews each domain carefully, evaluating aspects such as:

   * Brand safety

   * Ad type verification
 
   * Generic content, duplicate domains, and fake ad serving

* **Tiering:** We holistically examine brand presence in the overall ecosystem to classify inventory across different tiers. You can [target your placements](/help/dsp/campaign-management/placements/placement-settings.md) to these tiers for the desired level of reach:

   * **[!UICONTROL T1]** – Brand-name, internationally-recognizable sites

   * **[!UICONTROL T2]** – Great-looking sites that are current, up-to-date, without user-generated content, and usually lacking in global recognition

   * **[!UICONTROL T3]** – User-generated content and niche content

* **Site categorization:** To ensure easy content targeting and blocking, we tag each property with an Advertising Cloud-defined site category based on the property's content. You can [target or exclude these site categories for each placement](/help/dsp/campaign-management/placements/placement-settings.md) based on the placement goals.

### Comprehensive Support for Site Blocking

Advertising Cloud DSP provides both a globally blocked sites list and the option to create custom blocked sites lists for advertisers and accounts.

#### Advertising Cloud DSP Globally Blocked Sites List

Advertising Cloud DSP maintains a globally blocked sites list of sites deemed unsafe to run ads on. This list contains sites featuring objectionable content (such as hate or terror) and sites infected by bots, fake pre-roll, mismatched domains, and other fraudulent activity.

As part of our Brand Safety initiative to root out activities that defraud advertisers, all sites are screened using the measures in the chart blocked sites list. All sites that don't pass the brand safety checks are added to the globally blocked sites list. Because Advertising Cloud DSP manages this list dynamically, sites may move on or off the list at any time, based on the latest brand safety analysis.

When you include a site on the globally blocked sites list as a placement target, the site is flagged with a red exclamation point (!). This indicates that ads will not run on the flagged site.

#### Account-level and Advertiser-level Blocked Sites Lists

Users can also maintain account-level and advertiser-level blocked sites lists<!-- [account-level and advertiser-level blocked sites lists](/help/dsp/admin/blocked-sites-list-edit.md) -->, which are used automatically for all placements. Lower-level blocked sites list are applied in addition to the globally blocked sites list.

## Third-party Integrations

### Contextual Filtering

Contextual filtering allows you to target or block ad opportunities based on the context of the page on which the ad would serve. Adobe provides contextual filtering via integrations with leading vendors in the industry: [!DNL Comscore], [!DNL DoubleVerify], [!DNL Integral Ad Science], and [!DNL Peer39]. Examples of current filters include [!UICONTROL Adult Content], [!UICONTROL Natural Disasters], [!UICONTROL Legal Drinking Age], [!UICONTROL MANGA], [!UICONTROL Epidemics], and [!UICONTROL G-rated Sites].

You can set default contextual filter controls for each advertiser<!-- [default contextual filter controls for each advertiser](/help/dsp/admin/advertiser-settings.md) -->, and then optionally [customize the settings for each placement](/help/dsp/campaign-management/placements/placement-settings.md). Additional fees may apply when you use this feature.

### Topic Targeting

DSP topic targeting allows you to target or block keyword lists by leveraging our industry-leading contextual partners [!DNL Comscore] and [!DNL Oracle Data Cloud] ([!DNL Grapeshot]).

Topic targeting helps you to ensure your ads are always served in an environment that aligns with your brand, whether that includes blocking harmful content or ensuring spend in a context that ensures a greater outcome.

Topic targeting requires you to create custom topic segments directly with [!DNL Comscore] or [!DNL Grapeshot] (using [!DNL Oracle Data Cloud]). Once these are created in the partner platform, you can [target or exclude a segment ID in the [!UICONTROL Audience Targeting] section for each placement](/help/dsp/campaign-management/placements/placement-settings.md). Additional fees may apply for this feature.

* To create a [!DNL Comscore] account and create custom segments, you can request a login for [!DNL Activation Segment Manager] at http://agents.comscore.com/. The process includes an assignment for Google. See the [[!DNL Comscore] help center](https://comscoreactivation.zendesk.com/hc/) for full instructions for setting up custom segments. Fees for custom segments are visible in [!DNL Segment Manager] as you create them.

* To get started with [!DNL Oracle Data Cloud], contact [!DNL Oracle Data Cloud] or your [!DNL Adobe] account manager.
