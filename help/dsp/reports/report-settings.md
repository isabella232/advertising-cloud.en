* *[!UICONTROL Last Event]:* Attributes conversions to the last click or impression in the conversion path.  

* *[!UICONTROL Weight Last More]:* Attributes conversions to all events in the conversion path but gives the most weight to the last event and successively less weight to the preceding events.

* *[!UICONTROL Even Distribution]:* Attributes conversions equally to each event in the conversion path.

* *[!UICONTROL Weight First More]:* Attributes conversions to all events in the conversion path but gives the most weight to the first event and successively less weight to the following events.

* *[!UICONTROL First Event]:* Attributes conversions to the first click or impression in the conversion path.

* *[!UICONTROL U-shaped]:* Attributes the conversion to all events in the conversion path but gives the most weight to the first and last events, with successively less weight to the events in the middle of the conversion path.

* *[!UICONTROL Display Only]:*  Attributes conversions to the last DSP click or impression in the conversion path. This includes video and connected TV ads and excludes clicks on Advertising Cloud Search ads.
