# Optimization Goals and How to Use Them

| Optimization Goal | Description  | When to Use This Goal |
| -----------| ---------- | ---------- |
| [!UICONTROL Always Max Bid & Highest Clickthrough Rate] | With package-level optimization, budget allocation will prioritize  placements with the highest clickthrough rates.<br><br>Auction appraisals will prioritize CTR if spend goals are being met. The bid submitted will always be the set [!UICONTROL Max Bid], but the predicted CTR threshold will become stricter if a placement is spending well. | Campaign Type: Branding<br><br>Benchmark: Highest Clickthrough Rate<br><br>Ad types: Pre-roll, Display<br><br><b>Note:</b> Use this goal if you have a fixed CPM goal that doesn't need to be surpassed and a CTR goal that needs to be maximized. Set the Max Bid to the desired CPM goal, and DSP will achieve the best possible CTR while attempting to spend the full budget. |
| [!UICONTROL Always Max Bid & Highest Completion Rate] | With package-level optimization, budget allocation will prioritize placements with the highest completion rates.<br><br>Auction appraisals will prioritize Completion Rate if spend goals are being met. The bid submitted will always be the set Max Bid, but the predicted Completion Rate threshold will become stricter if a placement is spending well. | Campaign Type: Branding<br><br>Benchmark: Highest Completion Rate<br><br>Ad types: Pre-roll only<br><br><b>Note:</b> Use this goal if you have a fixed CPM goal that doesn't need to be surpassed and a Completion Rate goal that needs to be maximized. Set the Max Bid to the desired CPM goal, and DSP will achieve the best possible Completion Rate while attempting to spend the full budget. |
| [!UICONTROL Always Max Bid & Highest Engagement Rate] | With package-level optimization, budget allocation will prioritize placements with the highest engagement rates.<br><br>Auction appraisals will prioritize engagement rate if spend goals are being met. The bid submitted will always be the set Max Bid, but the predicted engagement rate threshold will become stricter if a placement is spending well. | Campaign Type: Branding<br><br>Benchmark: Highest Engagement Rate<br><br>Ad types: Mobile Interstitial only<br><br><b>Note:</b> Use this goal if you have a fixed CPM goal that doesn't need to be surpassed and an engagement goal that needs to be maximized. Set the Max Bid to the desired CPM goal, and DSP will achieve the best possible engagement rate while attempting to spend the full budget. |
| [!UICONTROL Always Max Bid & Highest Viewability Rate (Adobe – GroupM)] | With package-level optimization, budget allocation will prioritize placements with the highest viewability rates.<br><br>Auction appraisals will prioritize viewability rate if spend goals are being met. The bid submitted will always be the set Max Bid, but the predicted viewability rate threshold will become stricter if a placement is spending well. | Campaign Type: Branding<br><br>Benchmark: Highest Viewability Rate<br><br>Ad types: Interactive Pre-roll only<br><br><b>Note:</b> This goal will always use the placement-level Max Bid.<br><br>If the campaign's Viewability Sensitivity setting is set to “Standard (50% of ad in view for 2 consecutive seconds),” then the Media Rating Council (MRC) viewability measurement standard is used for the campaign. If the campaign is set to “Strict (100% of ad in view & audio on for 50% duration)” then the GroupM viewability measurement standard is used for the campaign. Ideally, you should match the campaign setting with the optimization goal and pre-bid filter settings. |
