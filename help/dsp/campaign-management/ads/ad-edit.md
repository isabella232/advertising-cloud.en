# Edit an Ad

1. In the main menu, click **[!UICONTROL Campaigns]**.
1. Click the name of the campaign.
1. In the submenu, click **[!UICONTROL Ads]**.
1. Next to the ad name, click  **... > [!UICONTROL Edit]**.
1. Edit the ad settings for [audio ads](ad-settings-audio.md), [connected TV](ad-settings-connected-tv.md), [display ads](ad-settings-display.md), [mobile ads](ad-settings-mobile.md), [native ads](ad-settings-native.md), or [pre-roll ads](ad-settings-pre-roll.md).

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >To change an ad URL, first re-traffic the ad on the ad server.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save and Close]**.

   The edited ad goes through a new [ad review](ad-about.md), which takes 24-48 hours and includes checks for sensitive categories, click URL functionality, and preview rendering. The [!UICONTROL Status] column indicates whether DSP has approved the ad. Broken ads may have a pending status for longer than 24-48 hours so you have time to fix errors before they're rejected.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Your ad will only be served if both DSP and the SSP have approved the creative. Each SSP has its own approval requirements and process.
