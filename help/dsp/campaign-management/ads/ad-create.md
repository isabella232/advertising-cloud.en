# Create a Third-Party Ad

To create multiple third-party ads at a time, see [Create Multiple Third-party Ads](ad-create-multiple.md).

>All of your settings are saved automatically, even before you submit the ad for review.

1. In the main menu, click **[!UICONTROL Campaigns]**.

1. Click the name of the campaign in which the ad will be included.

1. Above the data table, click **[!UICONTROL Create]**. In the [!UICONTROL Ad Types] section of the menu, click the [ad type](ad-types.md).

1. Specify the ad settings for [audio ads](ad-settings-audio.md), [connected TV](ad-settings-connected-tv.md), [display ads](ad-settings-display.md), [mobile ads](ad-settings-mobile.md), [native ads](ad-settings-native.md), or [pre-roll ads](ad-settings-pre-roll.md):

    1. On the [!UICONTROL Insert Ad Tag] screen, enter information about the ad from a certified third-party ad serving partner.

    1. On the [!UICONTROL Options] screen:

        1. On the [!UICONTROL Basics] tab, specify the ad details.

        1. (Optional) On the [!UICONTROL Pixel] tab, specify any third-party tracking pixels you want to attach to the ad.

1. When the ad is complete, click **[!UICONTROL Save & Submit for Review]**.

   The [ad review](ad-about.md) takes 24-48 hours and includes checks for sensitive categories, click URL functionality, and preview rendering. The Status column indicates whether DSP has approved the ad. Broken ads may have a pending status for longer than 24-48 hours so you have time to fix errors before they're rejected.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Your ad will only be served if both DSP and the SSP have approved the creative. Each SSP has its own approval requirements and process.
