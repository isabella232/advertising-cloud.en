# Manage Data Visualizations

You can change the metrics and chart mode for all data visualizations for a single campaign. The changes are applied across all data visualizations for the campaign, including the [!UICONTROL Packages], [!UICONTROL Placements], and [!UICONTROL Ads] tabs.

## Change the Metrics for a Data Visualization

1. In the upper right of the data visualization, click ![Settings](/help/dsp/assets/settings-chart.png).
1. Select the metrics.
   You can't select the same metric twice.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Apply]**.

## Change the Display Mode for a Data Visualization

* In the upper right of the data visualization, click the [!UICONTROL Overlay] switch (![Overlay switch](/help/dsp/assets/overlay.png)) to change between overlay mode (all charts overlaid together) and trellis chart mode (three separate charts).
