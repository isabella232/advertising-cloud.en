# Duplicate a Package

Duplicate a package to create a package with similar settings. You can:

* Duplicate the package within the original advertiser and campaign or within different ones
* Optionally duplicate the placements within the package
* (For duplicated packages within the original campaigns) Optionally duplicate the original ads and placement-level event pixels
* Modify the flight dates of the new package

See "[What's Not Duplicated](#package-not-duplicated)" for a list of placement settings that aren't duplicated.

1. Next to the package name, click  **... > Duplicate**.

         * Placements within the original package are copied to the new package.
