# Edit the Ad Schedule for a Placement

<!-- Some placements don't have this option. Clarify which placement types aren't eligible -- just simple ad serving placements (PG ones seem okay)? And anything else? -->

You can change the scheduled flight dates and ad rotation for the ads attached to a placement. Each ad can be active during multiple flights.

1. In the main menu, click **[!UICONTROL Campaigns]**.
1. Click the name of the campaign.
1. In the submenu, click **[!UICONTROL Placements]**.
1. Next to the placement name, click  **[!UICONTROL ...] > [!UICONTROL Ad schedule]**.
    1. Do any of the following:
        * To add a flight, click **[!UICONTROL Add Flight]**, and then specify the start date and end date.
        * To add an existing flight to an ad, click **[!UICONTROL +]** in the ad row for the flight column.
        * To remove an existing flight from an ad, click **[!UICONTROL x]** in the ad row for the flight column.
        * (When multiple ads have the same flight) To rotate the ads unevenly, click **[!UICONTROL Even Rotation]** in the flight information, and then enter the relative weight by which to rotate each ad, as a percentage.
            The total weights must equal 100.
    1. In the upper right, click **[!UICONTROL Continue]**.
    1. Review the flight details, and then click **[!UICONTROL Save & Finish]**.
