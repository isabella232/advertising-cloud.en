# Archive or Unarchive a Placement

<!-- Some placements don't have this option. Clarify which placement types aren't eligible -- is it PG placements, or all placements using private inventory? And anything else?  -->

Hide a placement that isn't being used by archiving it. The only action you can take on an archived placement is to unarchive it. Archived placements aren't shown by default but are still available for reporting.

You can unarchive a placement to restore its previous status at any time.
