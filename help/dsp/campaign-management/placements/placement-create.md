# Create a Placement

>[!TIP]
>
>Create placements based on specific campaign goals or reporting needs.

1. In the main menu, click **[!UICONTROL Campaigns]**.

1. Click the name of the campaign in which the placement will be included.

1. Above the data table, click **[!UICONTROL Create]**. In the [!UICONTROL Placement Types] section of the menu, click the placement type.

    The placement type determines the ad type that the placement can include.

1. Enter the [placement settings](placement-settings.md):

    1. Specify the [!UICONTROL Basics] settings.

    1. In the [!UICONTROL Goals] section, specify the [!UICONTROL Gross Budget] and, optionally, specify additional placement goals.
    
       Some fields have default values that you can override.

       If the package to which the placement is assigned has package-level pacing, then your goals and pacing settings will reflect the package settings.

    1. (Optional) In the [!UICONTROL Geo-Targeting] section, narrow down the locations that are included or excluded.
     
       If you don't identify specific locations, all locations are targeted.

       >[!NOTE]
       >
       >City and DMA locations aren't available for Roku placements.

    1. In the [!UICONTROL Inventory Targeting] section, narrow down the inventory sources to include or exclude.

       For most placement types, all inventory types, and all sources for each type, are included by default. For [!DNL Roku] placements, you must specify the inventory type and sources.

    1. (Optional) In the [!UICONTROL Site Targeting] section, narrow down the sites that you want to target, and specify any sites that you want to exclude.

    1. (Optional) In the [!UICONTROL Audience Targeting] section:
    
       1. Narrow down the audience. This includes selecting audience segments to target within the placement.

          For [!DNL] Roku placements, you can leverage [DSP’s unique audience matching with [!DNL Roku]](/help/dsp/inventory/roku-inventory.md) by including one or more one audience segments that can be matched against the [!DNL Roku] (opted-in) deterministic dataset.
      
      1. (For campaigns with people-level cross-device targeting; optional) When the placement targets one or more specific audiences, enable people-based cross-device targeting for the placement.
      
          People-based cross-device targeting is provided by [!DNL LiveRamp] using U.S. data only. The service is available to all advertisers at $0.35 CPM for impressions that are delivered by using the [!DNL LiveRamp] device graph (that is, for devices not found within the targeted audience segments).

    1. (Optional) In the [!DNL Brand Safety and Media Targeting] section, apply brand safety restrictions for your placements.

    1. (Optional) In the [!DNL Tracking] section, enter third-party event pixels or conversion pixels for ads in the placement.

        >[!NOTE]
        >
        >([!DNL Roku] placements) Third-party pixel vendors approved by [!DNL Roku] include [!DNL Acxiom], [!DNL comScore], [!DNL Data Plus Math], [!DNL Experian], [!DNL Factual], [!DNL Kantar], [!DNL Marketing Evolution], [!DNL Neustar], [!DNL Nielsen], [!DNL Nielsen Catalina Solutions], [!DNL NinthDecimal], [!DNL Oracle], [!DNL Placed], [!DNL Polk], and [!DNL Research Now].
