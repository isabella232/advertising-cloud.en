>Setting up programmatic guaranteed deals with publishers on [!DNL FreeWheel] requires extra permissions and steps. See "[Overview of Setting up Programmatic Guaranteed Deals in FreeWheel](freewheel-overview.md)" for more information.

1. In the main menu, click **[!UICONTROL Inventory] > [!UICONTROL Deals].**

1. Above the list of [!UICONTROL Deals], click the blue bar to open the [!UICONTROL Deal ID inbox].

1. (Optional) To refresh the deal details, click **[!UICONTROL Refresh]**.

   DSP automatically refreshes all deal details daily at 4:30 a.m. EST. It also refreshes all [!DNL FreeWheel] deals and updates existing deals from [!DNL Google] and [!DNL Rubicon] hourly.

1. (If you previously ignored the deal) Click the **[!UICONTROL Ignored Deals]** tab.

1. To review and confirm the deal details, such as the publisher and dates, hold the cursor over the deal row and click ![Review](/help/dsp/assets/review.png).

1. Do either of the following:

    * In the deal details, click **[!UICONTROL Accept]**.

    * In the [!UICONTROL Deal ID inbox], hold the cursor over the deal row and click ![Accept](/help/dsp/assets/accept.png).

1. In the deal details:
    1. Complete the required information: **[!UICONTROL Publisher]**, **[!UICONTROL Media Type]**, and **[!UICONTROL Deal Access]** (the advertisers who will have access to the deal).
    1. (Optional) Specify additional accounts with which to share the deal or attach labels to the deal record.

    1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.
    
1. (Programmatic guaranteed deals only) Follow the prompts to select an ad for the deal and create a programmatic guaranteed default placement that targets the deal.
