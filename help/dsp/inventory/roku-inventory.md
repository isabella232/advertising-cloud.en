# Using [!DNL Roku] Inventory

Advertising Cloud DSP provides unique features for advertising on [!DNL Roku].

## The Advertising Cloud DSP and [!DNL Roku] Partnership

Roku and Advertising Cloud DSP have a unique partnership that matches your [!DNL DSP] audiences to [!DNL Roku] IDs for 1:1 deterministic audience targeting on [!DNL Roku] inventory.

Outside of Roku’s own DSP (OneView), Advertising Cloud DSP has sole access to these targeting capabilities. Advertising Cloud DSP is also the only DSP with permission to measure [!DNL Roku] supply next to all other connected TV (CTV) inventory. Because [!DNL Roku] doesn't share all of the standard RTB and impression pixel signals, no other DSP can target or measure across Roku-sold CTV supply.

## [!DNL Roku] Inventory Options

You can either a) set up private deal IDs directly with [!DNL Roku] and then enter the deal ID data into DSP or b) visit the [!DNL On Demand] Gallery to subscribe to [!DNL Roku] profiles:
