# Manually Create Deal ID Details

1. In the main menu, click **[!UICONTROL Inventory] > [!UICONTROL Deals].**

1. Above the data table, click **[!UICONTROL Create]**, and then select **[!UICONTROL Deal ID]**.

1. Enter the [deal settings](deal-id-settings.md):

    1. In the [!UICONTROL Deal ID basics] section, specify the deal details and the advertisers who can access the deal. For guaranteed deals, you must also specify the planned flight dates and the estimated of impressions, for tracking purposes only.

    1. (Administrator users only; optional) In the [!UICONTROL Technical] section, edit the default settings as needed.

    1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

1. (Guaranteed deals only) Select the ads that will be used for the deal and create a default programmatic guaranteed (PG) placement.

   Default PG placements ensure that your deal will always return a bid for every bid request. If you don't create a default PG placement, then any placements that target the deal won't place bids unless they're set up correctly. You should always create a default PG placement. In the [!UICONTROL Placements] view, default PG placements have a [!UICONTROL Sub-type] column value of "[!UICONTROL PG Default]."
   
   You can optionally use the deal as an inventory target in additional placements but must set them up correctly to place bids.

    1. In the [!UICONTROL Ad & Campaign Selection] settings, select the ads that will be used for the deal:

       1. Select the advertiser, campaign, and ad type.
        
       1. From the list of available ads, select the check box next to each ad that will be used for the deal.

       1. Click **[!UICONTROL Apply]**.

    1. In the placement settings screen:
    
       1. Enter the placement name.
        
       1. (Optional) Edit the [placement settings](/help/dsp/campaign-management/placements/placement-settings.md), including overwriting the default bid, which is automatically populated with the CPM value from the deal; changing the date range; or attaching more ads.
       
         The deal is automatically targeted in the Inventory Targets section. All other targeting options are inapplicable.

       1. Click **[!UICONTROL Create placement]**.

After you create the deal, you can use the deal as an inventory target for multiple placements.

>[!NOTE]
>
> You don't need to send the deal tag to the publisher for verification.

>[!TIP]
>
>* In the [!UICONTROL Inventory] > [!UICONTROL Deals] view, the [!UICONTROL Pacing & Budget] column shows how the deal is pacing to the specified flight date and impression goal.
>
>* If delivery is under- or over-pacing, contact your publisher to adjust how much volume it is sending through the deal.
