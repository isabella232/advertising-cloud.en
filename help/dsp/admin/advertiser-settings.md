## [!UICONTROL General] Settings

**[!UICONTROL Advertiser Name]:** The advertiser name.

**[!UICONTROL Category]:** The category in which the advertiser’s business operates. The category will be communicated to the publishers when you bid on inventory. Make sure you choose a category that aligns with your ads, or publishers may reject your ads.

>[!NOTE]
>
>If you select *[!UICONTROL Other]*, then the advertiser won't be able to access DSP [!DNL On Demand Inventory].

**[!UICONTROL Advertiser URL]:** The advertiser’s homepage or main website URL (beginning with `http://` or `https://`).

**[!UICONTROL Share all private exchange feeds into this advertiser]:** (New advertiser accounts only) Makes all private exchange feeds configured for the organization's DSP account available to the advertiser.

### [!UICONTROL Adobe IMS IDs]

Advertisers with additional Adobe Experience Cloud products can share data across some products using the company's unique [!DNL Organization ID] for Experience Cloud. You can configure specific product integrations in the [!UICONTROL Integrations] section.

**[!UICONTROL Account IMS org and ID]:** (Advertisers with additional Experience Cloud products that are licensed through an Experience Cloud account with multiple advertisers; optional) The account's Experience Cloud [!DNL Organization ID].

**[!UICONTROL Advertiser IMS org and ID]:** (Advertisers with direct licenses for additional Experience Cloud products; optional) The advertiser's Experience Cloud [!DNL Organization ID].

### [!UICONTROL Integrations]

(Optional) Additional Experience Cloud products linked to the DSP account. The products must be associated with the same Experience Cloud [!DNL Organization ID] provided in the [!UICONTROL Adobe IMS IDs] section.

**[!UICONTROL Adobe Media Optimizer]:** (Advertisers with Advertising Cloud Search or who use Advertising Cloud conversion pixels) A [!DNL Search] account with which DSP will exchange attribution data.

**[!UICONTROL Adobe Device Co-op or 3rd Party Graph]:** (Advertisers who use Advertising Cloud conversion pixels; optional) You can leverage a device graph for person-based attribution measurement from the advertiser's account settings in Advertising Cloud Search.

>[!NOTE]
>
> * Device attribution is available only for conversions tracked using the Advertising Cloud conversion tracking service, not conversions tracked by Adobe Analytics.
> * You can also select a person-based device graph for cross-device targeting and frequency management at the [campaign level](/help/dsp/campaign-management/campaigns/campaign-settings.md). You can then set up cross-device targeting at the [placement level](/help/dsp/campaign-management/placements/placement-settings.md) and further frequency caps at the [package level](/help/dsp/campaign-management/packages/package-settings.md) and [placement level](/help/dsp/campaign-management/placements/placement-settings.md). Cross-device targeting and frequency management don't require advertiser-level attribution measurement; instead, they work with the device graph that's specified in the campaign settings.

**[!UICONTROL Adobe Analytics]:** (Advertisers with Adobe Analytics; optional; applicable only to data collected using Advertising Cloud conversion tracking tags that include an [!DNL EF Redirect] and token only) One or more [!DNL Analytics] report suites to which DSP will send data it collects from publishers and supply-side partners. Analytics will also send the data it collects from the client’s site to DSP.

For the data to appear in the report suites, the [!DNL Search] advertiser-level setting to "[!UICONTROL Enable tracking for SAINT feeds]" must be enabled. In addition, the advertiser's [!DNL Analytics] account must be configured to receive data from Advertising Cloud. <!-- from Advertising Cloud or DSP in particular? Add cross-reference to file in Integrations section. -->

>[!WARNING]
>
>If you remove a previously linked report suite, DSP will no longer exchange data with that suite. Expect to see data fluctuations. <!-- Fluctuations where? Clarify -->

**[!UICONTROL Adobe Analytics Cloud]:** (Advertisers with Adobe Audience Manager or Adobe Analytics; optional) An Audience Manager or [!DNL Analytics] account from which DSP will pull in segment metadata, hierarchy data, and unique audience data for all of the advertiser's Adobe audiences. This includes data for:

* Audience Manager segments
* [!DNL Analytics] segments that are published to Adobe Experience Cloud
* Segments that are created in Adobe Experience Cloud using the [!DNL People core service]
* Segments that are created in Adobe Experience Platform and sent to Advertising Cloud via Audience Manager

The initial sync takes about 24 hours. After that, data is synced in real time, with a one- to two- second delay.
<!-- I don't think this is true anymore:
Segment membership data is sent to Advertising Cloud only after one of the following:

* The segment is targeted in an Advertising Cloud placement or audience library
* The segment is added to the Advertising Cloud batch and real-time destinations within the Audience Manager user interface
-->

## [!UICONTROL Targeting] Settings
