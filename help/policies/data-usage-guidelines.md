These Guidelines are incorporated by reference into the Agreement between Adobe and the Customer using the On-demand Services. Capitalized terms used in these Guidelines but not defined herein will have the meaning set forth in that Agreement.

I think the OS does that. Using HTML code for the parentheses doesn't prevent it. -->

In addition, [!DNL TruSignal] Data can’t be: (1) decompiled, disassembled, used to create derivative works, or reverse engineered; or (2) sublicensed, resold, reused, or otherwise granted any rights in to any third party, including any service bureau use.
