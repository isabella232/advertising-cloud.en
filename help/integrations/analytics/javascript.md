# JavaScript Code for [!DNL Analytics for Advertising Cloud]

*Advertisers with an Advertising Cloud-Adobe Analytics Integration Only*

*Advertisers with Advertising Cloud DSP only*

For Advertising Cloud DSP, the [!DNL Analytics for Advertising Cloud] integration tracks view-through and click-through site interactions. Click-through visits are tracked by the standard Adobe Analytics code on your webpages; the [!DNL Analytics] code captures the AMO ID and EF ID parameters in the landing page URL and tracks them in their respective reserved eVars. You can track view-through visits by deploying a JavaScript snippet in your webpages.

On the first page view of a visit to the site, the Advertising Cloud JavaScript code checks to see if the visitor has previously seen or clicked on an ad. If the user has previously entered the site via a click-through or hasn't seen an ad, then the visitor is ignored. If the visitor has seen an ad and hasn't entered the site via a click-through during the [click lookback window](/help/integrations/analytics/prerequisites.md#lookback-a4adc) set within Advertising Cloud, then the Advertising Cloud JavaScript code either a) uses the [Experience Cloud ID Service](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/id-service/using/home.html) to generate a supplemental ID (`SDID`) or b) uses the Adobe Experience Platform [!DNL Web SDK] `generateRandomID` method to generate a `[!DNL StitchID]`. Either ID is used to stitch data from Advertising Cloud to the visitor’s Adobe Analytics hit. Adobe Analytics then queries Advertising Cloud for the AMO ID and EF ID associated with the ad exposure. The AMO ID and EF IDs are then populated in their respective eVars. These values persist for a designated period (by default, 60 days).

[!DNL Analytics] sends site traffic metrics (such as page views, visits, and time spent) and any [!DNL Analytics] custom or standard events to Advertising Cloud hourly, using the EF ID as the key. These [!DNL Analytics] metrics then run through the Advertising Cloud attribution system to connect the conversions to the click and exposure history.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The Advertising Cloud JavaScript tracking logic occurs on the Adobe side and thus has virtually no impact to the page load time.
>
>In contrast, the logic for the [!DNL DCM] data connector to [!DNL Analytics] (using [!DNL Google Campaign Manager 360]) for Advertising Cloud DSP occurs on the client side. Client-side stitching slows down the page load and increases the risk of data loss. This occurs because the [!DNL Analytics] JavaScript must ping [!DNL DoubleClick] and wait for [!DNL DoubleClick] to pass back the last click/impression data to [!DNL Analytics]. When your [!DNL DSP] team sets up the [!DNL DCM] data connector, you must specify how long you're willing to delay the page.

## Deploying the JavaScript Code

The JavaScript library consists of two lines that allow [!DNL Analytics] and Advertising Cloud to communicate with each other. If the [!DNL Analytics for Advertising Cloud] integration was completed during the Advertising Cloud implementation, then you should have received this code with instructions on how to deploy it.

**(Implementations that use the Experience Cloud Identity Service `visitorAPI.js` code)**

```
<script>
     if("undefined" != typeof AdCloudEvent) 
          AdCloudEvent('IMS ORG Id');
</script>
<noscript><!-- fill in -->
</noscript>
```

**(Implementations that use the Experience Platform [!DNL Web SDK] `alloy.js`code)**

```
<script>
     if("undefined" != typeof AdCloudEvent) 
          stitchId = AdCloudEvent('IMS ORG Id').generateRandomId();
</script>
<noscript><!-- fill in -->
</noscript>
```

### Where to Place the Code

The [!DNL Analytics for Advertising Cloud] JavaScript function must come after the Experience Cloud ID Service but before your Analytics App Measurement code so that the supplemental ID (`SDID`) or `[!DNL StitchID]` can be included in your Analytics call.

### Validating Code Deployment

You can perform validation using any packet sniffer type of tool (such as [!DNL Charles], [!DNL Fiddler], or [!DNL Chrome Developer Tools]) by comparing the values of the four IDs between the request going to Advertising Cloud and the request going to [!DNL Analytics], as outlined below.

#### How to Confirm the Code with [!DNL Chrome Developer Tools] {#validate-js-chrome}

1. Open [!DNL Chrome Developer Tools] and click the **Network** tab.

1. Load a website page that contains the [!DNL Analytics for Advertising Cloud] JavaScript.

1. Filter the [!UICONTROL Network] tab by `last` and review two rows:

     ![Filtering on last](/help/integrations/assets/a4adc-code-validation-filter-last.png)

     * The first row is the call to the JavaScript library and is titled `last-event-tag-latest.min.js`.
     * The second row is the call sending the request to Advertising Cloud. It begins as follows: `_les_imsOrgId=[your_imsOrgId_here]&_les_url=[your_encoded_url]`
     
         If you don't see the call to Advertising Cloud, then it might not be the first page view of your visit. For testing purposes, you can remove the cookie so that the next call will be the first page view for the corresponding visit:
         
          1. On the Application tab, find the `adcloud` cookie, and verify that the cookie contains `_les_v` (last visit) with a value of `y` and a UTC epoch timestamp that expires in 30 minutes.
          1. Delete the `ad cloud` cookie and refresh the page.

1. (Implementations that use the Experience Cloud Identity Service `visitorAPI.js` code) Filter on `/b/ss` to see the Analytics hit.

     ![Filtering on `/b/ss`](/help/integrations/assets/a4adc-code-validation-filter-bss.png)

1.	(Implementations that use the Experience Platform [!DNL Web SDK] `alloy.js`code) Filter on `/interact` to verify that the request payload to the Edge Network contains `advertisingStitchID`.

     ![Filtering on `/interact`](/help/integrations/assets/a4adc-code-validation-filter-interact.png)

1. Compare the ID values between the two hits. All of the values will be in query string parameters except for the report suite ID in the Analytics hit, which is the URL path immediately after `/b/ss/`.

     | ID | Analytics Parameter | Edge Network | Advertising Cloud Parameter |
     | --- | --- | --- | --- |
     | Experience Cloud IMS Org | `mcorgid` |  | `_les_imsOrgid` |
     | Supplemental Data ID | sdid |  | `_les_sdid` |
     | Stitch ID |   | `advertisingStitchID` under the `_adcloud` property <!-- ???  -->  |  |
     | Analytics Report Suite | The value after `/b/ss/` | | `_les_rsid` |
     | Experience Cloud Visitor ID | mid |  | `_les_mid` |

     If the ID values match, then the JavaScript implementation is confirmed. Advertising Cloud will send the [!DNL Analytics] server any click-through or view-through tracking details if they exist.

#### How to Confirm the Code with [!DNL Adobe Experience Cloud Debugger]

1. Open the [[!DNL Adobe Experience Cloud Debugger]](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/debugger/using/run-debugger.html) on your homepage.
1. Go to the [!UICONTROL Network] tab.
1. In the [!UICONTROL Solutions Filter] toolbar, click [!UICONTROL Advertising Cloud] and [!UICONTROL Analytics].
1. In the [!UICONTROL Request URL – Hostname] parameter row, locate `lasteventf-tm.everesttech.net`.
1. In the [!UICONTROL Request – Parameters] row, audit the signals generated, similar to Step 3 in "[How to Confirm the Code with [!DNL Chrome Developer Tools]](#validate-js-chrome)."
     * (Implementations that use the Experience Cloud Identity Service `visitorAPI.js` code) Make sure the `Sdid` parameter matches the `Supplemental Data ID` in the Adobe Analytics filter.
     * (Implementations that use the Experience Platform [!DNL Web SDK] `alloy.js`code) Make sure the value of the `advertisingStitchID` parameter matches the `Sdid` sent to the Experience Platform Edge Network.
     * If the code isn't generating, then check to make sure the Advertising Cloud cookie has been removed in the [!UICONTROL Application] tab. Once it's removed, refresh the page and repeat the process.
